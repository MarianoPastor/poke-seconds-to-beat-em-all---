# poke seconds to beat em all!!!

Final game of 1st year of study

The player is Pikachu...

Yyou have to take rocks and use energy balls corresponding to the wheakness of the pokemon.
If you finish the game you can be in the top 3 players. Can you beat Red, Blue and Ash?.

The berrys allways gave you life points... or not?

The boss can use a special attack that will put the game on his side (or upside down?).

I enjoy if you enjoy it!!!
